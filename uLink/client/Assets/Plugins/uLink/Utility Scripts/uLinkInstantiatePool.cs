/// Use this script to make a pool of pre-instantiated prefabs that will be used 
/// when prefabs are network instantiated via uLink.Network.Instantiate().
/// </summary>
///
/// <remarks>
/// This wonderful script makes it possible to pool game objects (instantiated prefabs)
/// and uLink will use this pool of objects as soon as the gameplay code makes a call to
/// Network.Instantiate.
///
/// The wonderful part is that you do not have to change your code at all to use the pool
/// mechanism. This makes it very easy to check if your game is faster and more smooth
/// with a pool.
///
/// In some games, with lots of spawning NPCs, guided missiles etc, the pool
/// is very convenient to avoid the overhead of calling Object.Instantiate() and Object.Destroy().
///
/// The need for a pool is mainly to increase performance, Instantiating objects is a 
/// heavy operation in Unity. By load-testing the game with the uTsung tool it is easier to
/// make decisions when to use a pool for prefabs.
///
/// A normal scenario is to pool creator prefabs in the server scene and pool proxy prefabs
/// in the client scene.
/// 
/// The value minSize is the number of prefabs that will be instantiated at startup.
/// If the number of Instantiate calls does go above this value, the pool will be increased 
/// at run-time.
/// </remarks>
